1. An anonymous dataset containing each user’s salary (in dollars) and tenure as a data scientist (in years) is given.
salaries and tenures = [(83000, 8.7), (88000, 8.1), (48000, 0.7), (76000, 6), (69000, 6.5), (76000, 7.5), (60000, 2.5), (83000, 10), (48000, 1.9), (63000, 4.2)]
Find out the average salary for each tenure and print a massage according to its value, i.e. ”less than two”, ”between two and five” and ”more than five” tenure and group together the salaries correspond- ing to each bucket. Compute the average salary for each group.
2. Fortheabovedatathereseemstobeacorrespondencebetweenyearsofexperienceandpaidaccounts Users with very few and very many years of experience tend to pay; users with average amounts of experience don’t. Find out the condition for this correspondence and print it.
3. State the difference between the following:
i. all() and any()
ii. str and repr function
iii. sort and sorted
iv. random.choice and random.sample
4. Write a Python Script to generate random passwords (alphanumeric). Ask users to enter the length of password and number of passwords they want to generate and then print all the generated passwords.
5. What is Type Annotations? What are the uses of this in any python program? How to write this, give one example.
6. ReadalistsnamedStringList1containingstringsfromthekeyboard.GenerateastringMStringList1 that contains all items of StringList1 that are repeated twice or more number of times and print this list. By observing the outcome of MStringList1 perform the following tasks:
a. Check wather an item of MStringList1 occurs even number of times or odd number of times in StringList1.
b. Remove the ith (i ≥ 2) occurrence of a given word in a StringList1.
7. Count frequencies of various alphabets (Convert upper case into lower case and input given by user), plot the results for this as a bar chart with x-axis being the letter and y-axis as the corresponding frequency.
8. Use the following data to plot the number of applicant per year as a scatter plot.
year = [2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012] no application per year = [921261, 929198, 1043739, 1186454,
                           1194938, 1304495, 1356805, 1282000, 479651]

11. Plot the temperature extremes in certain region of India for each month, starting in January, which are given by (in degrees Celsius).
        max:  17, 19, 21, 28, 33, 38, 37, 37, 31, 23, 19, 18
        min:  -62, -59, -56, -46, -32, -18, -9, -13, -25, -46, -52, -58
12. Python Program to find all Numbers in a Range (given by user) which are Perfect Squares and Sum of all Digits in the Number is Less than 10.
13. Plot a bar chart with axis labels for given data:
        mentions = [500, 505]
        years = [2017, 2018]
Do not give any extra condition for x-axis as well as y-axis. Now again plot the bar chart for this data and start y-axis from 0.
State the difference in both the bar chart.
14. Plot the scatter plot for following data with unequal axis and then equal axis. Also state the difference in two.
